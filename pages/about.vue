        >Hi there! My name is Rob &amp; welcome to TDEECalculator.net! My cousin Jake and I co-own this website together. We both became interested in fitness from a relatively young age, and when I began to learn programming as a hobby, Jake convinced me to build this site because he thought it would be a fun project! He was so rightâ€¦ I love running this site and I LOVE reading all the email I get from folks saying how much it has helped them. If you are one of those people I'd love to hear from you too. It might not seem like it, but TDEECalculator.net has thousands of lines of code powering it and it's quite popular! Jake likes design and I do all the coding as well as make sure the site is fast. If it's running slow or you have any suggestions, please contact us.</p>
